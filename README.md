💸 Expense Tracker – Python CLI Project
Expense Tracker is a simple command-line Python project I built to log and track daily expenses.
It’s a menu-driven CLI app where you can:
    Add expenses with a category and note
    View all previous entries
    Calculate your total spending
    Reset the database anytime you want a fresh start
    Everything is stored in a local SQLite database, so your data is saved even after closing the app.

📌 What I Used :

    Python (basics, functions, OOP, try/except)
    SQLite (to save all expenses)
    Datetime module (to timestamp each expense)
    Command-line interface (text-based menu)

🧪 How It Works
    When you run the project, it shows a simple CLI menu:

    💸 Expense Tracker Menu:

    1. Add an expense
    2. View expenses
    3. View total expenses
    4. Reset the database
    5. Exit

You can type the number, and it will prompt you for details (like amount, category, and note).
Each entry is timestamped and saved to a local database file called expenses.db.

🙋‍♂️ Why I Made This
As a CS student learning Python, I wanted to build a real, working app that stores and organizes data. This project helped me learn:
How to use SQLite with Python
How to design a clean CLI experience
How to handle input errors gracefully
That simple tools like this can actually be very useful 😄
